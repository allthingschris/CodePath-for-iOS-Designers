# Tumblr

The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to create custom navigation. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Tumblr.

Time spent: 4.5 hours. No West Wing this week.

## Completed Required User Stories

- [X] Tapping on Home, Search, Account, or Trending should show the respective screen and highlight the tab bar button.
- [X] Compose button should modally present the compose screen.

## Optional User Stories

- [X] Compose screen is faded in while the buttons animate in.
- [X] Login button should show animate the login form over the view controller.
- [X] Discover bubble should bob up and down unless the SearchViewController is tapped.

## The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] Nothing this week because I was a little pinched for time.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Simplifying functions. I did things sorta brute force this week just to knock it out. I could have probably written way more efficient code in certain places. I think it would be helpful to go back and redo these assignments at some point, just to see how much cleaner code I could write.
2. And for the life of me, I couldn't get my stupid status bar to go white. Any ideas on that one?

## Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
