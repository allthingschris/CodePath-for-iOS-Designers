# Tips! 2.0
Working on a revised copy of a my Tips calculator. 

Time spent: 3 hours in total (bulk of this was on an issue with Xcode that I still haven't resolved, see notes)

Completed user stories:

* Required: A tip calculator that works. :)
* Optional: Changed colors and fonts for the views.
* Optional: App icon and launch image.
* Optional: Experimented around with auto-layout and constraints.
* Optional: Added the ability to split payment.


Notes:
Spent some time exploring auto-layout and constraints, so this will work on multiple device sizes. Also added support for splitting the tip between multiple people. Had some issues getting the UISegmentedControls to link back to the existing functions (replicated on a number of machines, yet Tim was able to get it to work on his side). I'm going to keep investigating this. In the mean time, I hacked a solution to work by duplicating the function for each UISegmentedControl. So it works.... that means it ships, right? ;)
